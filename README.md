# Album Lists for Spotify

## About

I primarily think of music in terms of albums, but Spotify's options for library organization are mostly centered around tracks and playlists. The options for organizing albums are limited to alphabetical and date-added sorting. I wanted a way to group albums the way playlists allow grouping tracks.

So I made this: a static, single-page webapp that uses the Spotify API to display the albums represented in a playlist. It provides a different view into the existing organizational structures provided by Spotify. Albums are shown in the order they are represented in each playlist. When you click on one, it opens the album in the Spotify app.

The app is live at **[https://albums.mattb.io/](https://albums.mattb.io/)**
